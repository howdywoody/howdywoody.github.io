对于翠苑，他总有无限的情感。记得七八年前他初到杭州这个新城市，第一站便落脚在了这里。在此后的多年里，不管是他生活和工作怎么来回变化，翠苑总是扮演了重要的角色，犹如最大公约数。

他很喜欢翠苑街道的感觉，这里不禁让他想起小时候住了超过十年的水心街区。翠苑和水心都是差不多八九十年代建成的，高度相似的房屋结构和布局，街区规模也相仿，甚至连街坊邻居的风格也是。

但从现代的、”更高级的“角度来看，翠苑和水心一样，都应该是“破败”的。糟糕的楼间距和采光、颇具年代感的墙皮颜色、很高的绿化率、再辅以小公园，这仿佛是那个年代建房的模板。时光的风化，墙上的漆皮缝缝补补，路灯泛着黄色的昏沉，电线杆上缠满了让人看不懂的线，对楼高压锅的开锅气鸣和家庭吵架声飘散到他的房间，他望向窗外，路灯下的水泥路边，一个酒鬼正骂骂咧咧。

他喜欢教工路附近的一小饭店的肉末茄子，喜欢一老乡开的温州美食，喜欢每天到点就会出现的烧烤车。他还喜欢学院路的康奈店——在那儿他第一次将自己扮成个大人模样，喜欢那年起认识一路互相见证的Tony老师，喜欢在翠苑电影院和银乐迪欢腾的感觉。

翠苑见证了很多像他一样的人的成长过程。在这里，他们生根发芽。他们结实新朋友，又送别了朋友。在KTV里肆意高歌，又在路边扶墙而醉。在写字楼里几多加班，又在应酬局中觥筹交错。他们这些孩子开始越来越像个大人，也慢慢地搬离了翠苑。于他们，盒马替代了物美，骑车开车替代了公交车，IMAX替代了3D，更好的生活商圈替代了这老旧的街区。有一天，他再度路过翠苑，才会发现自己已经走了这么远了。他开始怀念当初的自己，心中的梦想曾让他每天的能量无穷无尽，怀念为了爱义无反顾的冲劲。如今，他变得成熟了，做事儿更稳重了，某些维度的生活也更好了，但或多或少也少了几番少年气。新与旧的不断交织，塑造了他的独一无二，但他知道，这儿是他的original。

人们总向往星辰大海，想活成电视剧主角的形态，但却常常没注意到，小满应是莫大的知足。那年马路旁的与好兄弟们的可乐配撸串的美好，当时的他也许没发现，那一刻他是多么的幸福。

李志在他的《热河》中记叙了他所生活的热河路：梧桐、垃圾、灰尘、杂货店、5元理发店、秋林龙虾、盐仓桥、挹江门、32路、奔忙的新南京人、潘西…… 

李志的歌词里没有一处他熟悉的地方，但他却莫名的亲切。李志唱的南京他没有长久待过，但他依然会从中听得热泪盈眶。在热河的歌声中，我们祭奠着我们各自的热河路。

你好！再见~

He always had an infinite affection for Cuiyuan. He remembers that seven or eight years ago, when he first arrived in the new city of Hangzhou, Cuiyuan was his first stop. In the years that followed, no matter how his life and work changed, Cuiyuan always played an important role, like the greatest common denominator.

He liked the feeling of the streets in Cuiyuan, which reminded him of the Shuixin neighborhood where he lived for over ten years as a child. Both Cuiyuan and Shuixin were built around the 1980s and 1990s, with highly similar housing structures and layouts. The neighborhood scale was also similar, and even the style of the neighbors was alike.

However, from a modern, "higher" perspective, both Cuiyuan and Shuixin could be seen as "dilapidated." The poor spacing between buildings and the lighting, the outdated wall colors, and the high greenery rates, along with small parks, seemed to be the template for houses built in that era. The erosion of time, the patched-up paint on the walls, the yellowish glow of streetlights, and the tangled wires on the poles created an inexplicable sense. The sounds of a pressure cooker and family quarrels drifted into his room from the building across, and as he looked out the window, he saw a drunkard cursing by the roadside under the streetlight.

He enjoyed the minced pork with eggplant at a small restaurant near Jiaogong Road, liked the Wenzhou cuisine run by a fellow townsman, and liked the barbecue cart that appeared every day at a certain time. He also liked the Kangnai store on Xueyuan Road—where he first dressed like an adult. He appreciated Tony, whom he met that year and who became a long-standing witness to his life, and he enjoyed the lively atmosphere of the Cuiyuan Cinema and Yinledi.

Cuiyuan witnessed the growth of many people like him. Here, they took root and sprouted. They met new friends and bid farewell to others. They sang loudly in KTVs and got drunk by the roadside. They worked overtime in office buildings and clinked glasses at social gatherings. These kids began to look more like adults and gradually moved away from Cuiyuan. For them, Hema replaced Wumart, cars and bikes replaced buses, IMAX replaced 3D, and better commercial areas replaced the old neighborhoods. One day, when he passed by Cuiyuan again, he realized how far he had gone. He began to miss his younger self, the dreams that filled him with endless energy every day, and the courage to pursue love without hesitation. Now, he has matured, become more stable in handling matters, and achieved better aspects of life, but he has lost some of the youthful spirit. The constant interplay of new and old has shaped his uniqueness, but he knows this is his origin.

People always long for the stars and the sea, wanting to live like the main characters in TV dramas, but often fail to notice that "small satisfaction" is a great blessing. The beauty of enjoying cola and skewers with good brothers by the roadside was something he might not have realized at the time, but it was a moment of great happiness.

Li Zhi's song "Rehe" describes his life on Rehe Road: plane trees, garbage, dust, grocery stores, 5-yuan barber shops, Qiulin crayfish, Yancangqiao, Yijiangmen, the No. 32 bus, busy new Nanjing people, Panxi...

There is no familiar place in Li Zhi's lyrics, yet it inexplicably feels intimate. He had never stayed long in the Nanjing that Li Zhi sang about, but he still listened to it with tears in his eyes. In the song of Rehe, we each commemorate our own Rehe Road.

Hello! Goodbye~

—Written on the evening of June 2, 2023, passing by Cuiyuan.
