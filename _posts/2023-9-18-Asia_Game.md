### 中国人最深的爱国主义在为亚运会让道

1931年9月18日是日本帝国主义、军国主义侵略中国的开始。每年的 9 月 18 日，中国各地都会鸣汽笛、拉防空警报以作后人对军国主义的警示和爱国主义教育。今年 9 月 18 日恰逢亚运会开幕前夕，杭州市在今年停止了 9·18 鸣笛和防空警报演习。除了为亚运服务，我们难以找到一个令人信服的理由。

杭州是中国人的杭州，不是外国人的杭州。哪怕在国际友人都来到杭州的情况下，这些类似的活动和习俗都不应该以这样的方式停止。在这个民族受难日以这样的方式暂停相关活动，是大众无法接受的。这是一种背叛民族精神的行为，是对爱国主义的一种践踏。中国人民将不再像以前那么能接受政府的爱国主义宣传，这将造成更糟糕的后果。

### The Deepest Feelings of Patriotism of the Chinese Is Making Way for the Asian Games

September 18th, 1931 was the beginning of the Japanese imperialist and militaristic aggression against China. Every year on September 18th, all parts of China will sound whistles and raise air defense alarms as a warning and patriotic education for future generations. On September 18th this year, coinciding with the opening eve of the Asian Games, Hangzhou stopped the 9.18 siren and air defense siren exercises this year. Aside from serving the Asian Games, we could hardly find a compelling reason. 

Hangzhou is the Hangzhou of the Chinese, not a city mainly serving for the foreigners. Even when international friends come to Hangzhou, these similar activities and customs should not stop in this way. It is unacceptable for the public to suspend activities in this way on this National Disaster Day. This is an act of betrayal of the national spirit and a trampling on patriotism. The Chinese people will no longer be as receptive to the government's patriotic propaganda as they once were. It will have even worse consequences.
