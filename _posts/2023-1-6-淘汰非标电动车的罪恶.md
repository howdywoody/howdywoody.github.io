长期以来，中国大陆存在非常多旧国标电动车，这些电动车按照以前的国家生产标准，合法生产、销售和使用。2018年新国标推出，政府开始不断地采取措施，强制淘汰旧国标电动车，并将在2023年开始强制扣车清理。 

### 政府更新淘汰电动车的理由一般分为两种：1. 旧国标电动车存在安全隐患；2. 新国标更环保。

从政策过渡的这三年时间来看，旧国标存在的改装问题，新国标电动自行车同样存在，究其根本就是生产标准无法贴合人民的正常使用需求。

而环保问题更是无从谈起，旧国标电动车的淘汰报废工作存在大量污染，新的电动车电池的生产过程同样存在污染。使用环保≠生产环保，这与电动汽车的制造同样类似。

最好的解释就是强制拉动生产消费的需求，毕竟近几年的一二线城市新国标电动车每年都新增数量保守估算在100万以上。 

### 对于强制换新我个人比较排斥几个方面。 
1. 是政府冠冕堂皇的理由里充满了欺骗，不顾及人民的真实感受，脱离了人民群众。
2. 非标电动自行车虽给了转黄牌上路的通道，但黄牌管理下的规则又给不少人设下了阻碍。
3. 政府虽表面上推出的置换补贴，但非标电动车使用者仍需要自己承担部分损失，这部分钱不应由人民来承担，这不关乎金额大小的问题。
4. 非标电动自行车在购买和使用时均合法，政府不应该也无权剥夺他们的上路权利。

### The evil of eliminating the old-national-standard electric bicycles

For a long time, there have been many old-national-standard electric bicycles in China, which are legally produced, sold and used in accordance with the previous national production standards. In 2018, the new-national-standard was launched, and the government began to take measures to enforce the elimination of old-national-standard electric bicycles, and will begin to seizure electric bicycles in 2023. 

#### The government’s reasons for phasing out electric bicycles are generally divided into two aspects. 

There are potential safety hazards in the old-national-standard electric bicycles; From the perspective of the policy transition period in the last three years, the bicycles modification problems of the old-national-standard, also existing in the new-national-standard electric bicycles, the root cause is that the production standard cannot meet the normal use needs of the general public. 

The new-national-standard electric bicycles is more environmentally friendly. The environmental protection problem is groundless. There is a lot of pollution in the scrapping of the old-national-standard electric bicycles. And the production process of the new electric bicycle battery is polluted alike. The real and best explanation is to creat the demand for production and consumption. 

After all, in recent years, more than 1 million new-national-standard electric bicycles have been come into use every year in first- and second-tier cities in China. 

### I personally take notice of following aspects. 
1. It is the high-sounding reasons of the government that are full of deception, disregarding the true feelings of the general public, and alienated from the masses of the people.
   
2. Although old-national-standard electric bicycles was given the choice to turn yellow licence plate, the rules under yellow licence plate management have set obstacles for many people.
  
3. Although the government ostensibly produced replacement subsidies, old-national-standard electric bicycles users still need to bear part of the losses, and this part of the money should not be borne by the people, which is not related to the size of the amount of money.
  
4. old-national-standard electric bicycles are totally legal when purchased and used, and the government should not and does not have the right to deprive their right to get on the road!
