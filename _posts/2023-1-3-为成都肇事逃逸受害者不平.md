捍衛法治底線，為成都交通肇事逃逸案受害者鳴不平！ 近日，成都一位摩托车驾驶者在正常行驶时被一辆变道汽车连续两次撞击后轮，造成了高度交通危险，但所幸没发生人和车的事故。该摩托车驾驶者立刻截停了该汽车司机。双方下车后经过一番对峙，汽车女司机见没有造成人和摩托的损伤，便不顾肇事逃逸的警告并扬言本人就是要逃逸去告我好了，随后强行开车离开。 此后的报案和办案中，交警最终从轻简单处理，仅处罚汽车女司机200元外加驾照扣3分。结果难以服众。在中国大陆，普通的交通肇事逃逸和交通肇事罪在法律上有清晰的划分和定义。肇事逃逸在过往事故案例中从不以是否造成实质损失为前提。正常情况下，该肇事逃逸事故至少应是近千元的罚款外加行政拘留，并附以其他的损失赔偿。 成都的交警队的处理结果，若没能在后续的行政复议或诉讼中获得合理的纠正，这一切将再次拉低了中国在该方面的法律的底线。这最基本的交通法规都无法在基层获得正常的实践，中国大陆的法治建设任重道远！

Recently, a motorcycle driver in Chengdu was hit by a lane-changing car twice in a row while driving normally, causing a high degree of traffic danger. But fortunately there were no damage involving people or motorcycle. The motorcyclist immediately stopped the involved car. After getting off the car, with a confrontation, seeing that there was no damage to people and motorcycle, ignoring the hit-and-run warning and threating to sue her, the female driver forcibly drove away. In the subsequent reporting and handling of the case, the traffic police finally dealt with it lightly and simply, merely punishing the female driver of the car 200 yuan plus 3 points deducted from the driver’s license. The results were unconvincing. In China, ordinary traffic hit-and-run and traffic hit-and-run crimes are clearly divided and defined in law. In past accident cases, hit-and-run has never been premised on whether it has caused substantial loss or not. Under normal circumstances, the hit-and-run accident should be judged with fine of at least nearly 1,000 yuan plus administrative detention, accompanied by other compensation pay. If the results of the traffic police force in Chengdu are not reasonably corrected in subsequent administrative reconsideration or litigation, all this will once again lower the bottom line of China’s laws in this regard. These most basic traffic laws and regulations cannot be practiced normally at the grassroots level. China’s construction of the rule of law has a long way to go!
