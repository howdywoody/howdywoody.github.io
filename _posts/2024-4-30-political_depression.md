In recent years, the concept of political depression has been appearing more frequently among us. 

What exactly is it? And how should we understand it and overcome it? 

I recently watched an interview with Dr. **Lusson**, who has some insights on this topic. I have organized and shared his content specifically for this purpose.

### 政治抑郁症是真的吗？它的核心是什么？它有什么诊断标准？
### Is political depression real? What is the core of the depression? What are its diagnostic criteria?

Political depression is indeed is depression with political factors and a recognized phenomenon characterized by feelings of powerlessness, hopelessness, frustration, anger, sadness and loss of control related to political events or the state of society. 

The core of political depression often stems from a sense of powerlessness or disillusionment with the political process, perceived injustices, or the inability to effect meaningful change.

It can be exacerbated by factors such as social exclusion, divisive rhetoric, polarization, social media echo chambers, and a constant bombardment of negative news. Ultimately, it's a complex interplay of individual psychological factors and external societal influences. Activists are easily suppressed socially and personally because they face difficulties but cannot change the situation.

Political depression is not a formal mental disorder, therefore, it does not have specific diagnostic criteria. It is commonly an informal term used to describe emotional distress and discomfort related to political events or societal conditions. However, some individuals may seek help from mental health professionals to cope with emotional distress related to politics. In such cases, clinicians may consider the individual's emotional symptoms, level of social dysfunction, and whether they meet other mental health diagnostic criteria when making diagnoses and treatment recommendations. Usually, at this stage, we can try applying similar diagnostic criteria from the psychological diagnostic manual DSM-5 for a rough estimate. Even though many people may not meet the criteria for the mental disorder based on DSM-5 standards, political depression should not be overlooked.
### 什么是政治抑郁症背后的驱动力？
### What is the main drive behind political depression?

The main drive behind political depression often stems from a combination of factors:

1. **Perceived Lack of Control**: Feeling powerless or unable to influence political outcomes can lead to feelings of frustration and helplessness.
2. **Perceived Injustice**: Witnessing or experiencing what one perceives as injustice within the political system or society can evoke feelings of anger, sadness, or despair.
3. **Polarization and Division**: Living in a politically polarized environment where there is little room for compromise or understanding between opposing viewpoints can contribute to feelings of alienation and isolation.
4. **Media Consumption**: Constant exposure to negative news and divisive political rhetoric via traditional media or social media can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and despair.
5. **Uncertainty about the Future**: Political instability or uncertainty about the future direction of society can create feelings of anxiety and unease about what lies ahead.
6. **Loss of Trust in Institutions**: Perceiving political institutions as corrupt, ineffective, or unresponsive to the needs of the people can erode trust and lead to feelings of disillusionment.

### 如何打破政治抑郁症的积习？它能治愈吗？
### How do we break the old routines of political depression? Can it be cured?

We may know, people with political depression often experience a strong sense of powerlessness towards uncertainty. Uncertainty about the future can bring anxiety, but it can also bring excitement and anticipation. Facing an unknown future requires courage and determination to confront the anxiety brought by uncertainty. There is a delicate balance between depression and anxiety, and the key is how to manage these emotions. When facing depression, gradually shift focus to the present moment, each waking moment is an opportunity to return to reality. Maintain focus and balance in the present moment, stay in the moment by observing the changes around you.

**In addition, there are some other points that need to be noted to reduce the impact of political depression:**

- **Self-awareness and acceptance**: Firstly, it is essential to recognize the potential impact of political depression and accept the presence of such emotions. Instead of denying or suppressing your feelings, attempt to understand and embrace them.
- **Limit media exposure**: Reduce excessive exposure to negative political news and social media. Choose trustworthy news sources, set specific time periods for obtaining news, and then try to avoid political engagement at other times.
- **Maintain physical and mental well-being**: Prioritize physical and mental health, including adequate sleep, healthy eating, moderate exercise, and regular relaxation activities.These can help reduce stress and anxiety.
- **Engage in active actions**: Actively participating in activities or organizations that promote positive societal change, such as volunteering, community service, or political engagement. By engaging in constructive activities, one can feel their own strength and influence.
- **Seek support**: Seek support and share your feelings with others. This can include talking to friends, family, or professional mental health practitioners to get support and advice.
- **Maintain a positive attitude**: Despite feeling discouraged when facing political depression, make an effort to stay optimistic. Look for hope and positive aspects, and believe in your ability to overcome challenges.
- **Seek professional help**: If political depression significantly impacts daily life, or even leads to serious emotional issues, seeking professional mental health help is essential. Methods like therapy and medication can help manage emotional distress and find effective coping strategies.

Political depression may not be completely cured, but it can be managed and alleviated through these efforts to improve quality of life and restore a positive mindset.  

Hope that everyone struggling with similar issues can have a better tomorrow.
